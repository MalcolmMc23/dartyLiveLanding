1. user picks a name
2. user clicks find random match button
3. user gets put into a queue of other people looking for a match (both people already in a call sesion and people who arent)
4. user finds a match (if the 2nd user that they match with is already in a call session the first user joins them. if both users are not in a session one of them creates a session and they both join)
5. when one user clicks the leave button, the user that leaves that call gets sent back to the initial page. the user that is left gets put back into the queue.

?????????

it seems like there is something wrong with how the queue works. please look deep. make sure it works like omegle. make sure the user flow works as follows:

1. user picks a name
2. user clicks find random match button
3. user gets put into a queue of other people looking for a match (both people already in a call sesion and people who arent)
4. user finds a match (if the 2nd user that they match with is already in a call session the first user joins them. ifa both users are not in a session one of them creates a session and they both join)
5. when one user clicks the leave button, the user that leaves that call gets sent back to the initial page. the user that is left gets put back into the queue. when the user is put back to the initial page they should keep their name but still be able to pick a new name and match again.

look through the code and make sure this is how it works. make a list of things that are broken if any.
